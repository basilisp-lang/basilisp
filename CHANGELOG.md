## [Unreleased]

### Fixed 
 * Fixed a regression introduced in #1176 where the testrunner couldn't handle relative paths in `sys.path`, causing `basilisp test` to fail when no arugments were provided (#1204)

## [v0.3.6]
### Added
 * Added support for the `:decorators` meta key in anonymous `fn`s (#1178)

### Changed
 * `import` now returns nil instead of the last module's string representation (#1174)
 *  The `:decorators` key now works in `defn` when passed as a metadata name key, expanding its support to `defn`-derived macros like `defasync` (#1178).
 * Change Python import machinery to be centered around Python code, rather than Basilisp namespaces (#1155, #1165)

### Fixed
 * Fix a bug in `defn` where the `attr-map?` and function metdata were merged into a seq instead of a map, causing `macroexpand` to fail in some cases (#1186)
 * Fix a bug where `basilisp.process/exec` threw an exception when inheriting the stdout stream from the current process (#1190)
 * Fix a bug where `condp` threw an exception in certain cases (#1194)

## [v0.3.5]
### Changed
 * `alter-var-root` now returns the new value to align with Clojure behavior. Updated the docstring to highlight side effects of direct linking optimization (#1166)

### Fixed
 * Fix a regression introduced in #1161 which prevented passing namespace metadata on the name in the `ns` macro (#1173)

## [v0.3.4]
### Added
 * Added support for the optional `attr-map?` on the `ns` macro (#1159)

### Added
 * Added support for a subset of qualified method syntax introduced in Clojure 1.12 (#1109)
 * Added the `basilisp.process` namespace (#1108)

### Changed
 * The Custom Data Readers Loader will only now examine the top directory and up to its immediate subdirectories of each `sys.path` entry, instead of recursive descending into every subdirectory, improving start up performance (#1135)

### Fixed
 * Fix a bug where tags in data readers were resolved as Vars within syntax quotes, rather than using standard data readers rules (#1129)
 * Fix a bug where `keyword` and `symbol` functions did not treat string arguments as potentially namespaced (#1131)
 * Fix a bug where `condp` would throw an exception if a result expression was `nil` (#1137)
 * Fix a bug where integer division which resulted in an integer would return a `fractions.Fraction` (#1140)
 * Fix a bug where `basilisp.core/time` would fail to expand with `macroexpand-all` in a nested macro call (#1143)
