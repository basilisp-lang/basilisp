(ns basilisp.process
  "An API for starting subprocesses which wraps Python's :external:py:mod:`subprocess`
  module.

  The primary API function is :lpy:fn:`start` which starts a subprocess and returns
  the :external:py:class:`subprocess.Popen` instance. You can wait for the process
  to terminate using :lpy:fn:`exit-ref` or you can manipulate it directly. You can
  fetch the streams attached to the process using :lpy:fn:`stdin`, :lpy:fn:`stdout`,
  and :lpy:fn:`stderr`. This namespace also includes an extension function
  :lpy:fn:`communicate` which wraps :external:py:meth:`subprocess.Popen.communicate`.

  This namespace also includes :lpy:fn:`exec` for starting a subprocess, waiting for
  its completion, and returning the stdout as a string.

  .. note::

     There are some minor differences between the Basilisp implementation and the source
     Clojure implementation. Because Python does not have the concept of an unopened
     ``File`` object as Java does, standard streams can only be passed existing open
     file handles or paths. If a path is given, the Basilisp :lpy:fn:`from-file` and
     :lpy:fn:`to-file` functions allow specifying the options that the file at that path
     will be opened with (including encoding, binary mode, etc.).

     In Clojure, as in the underlying ``java.lang.Process`` object, streams are always
     opened in binary mode and it is the responsibility of callers to encode and decode
     into strings as necessary. Python's ``subprocesss`` offers some flexibility to
     callers to specify string encoding for pipes by default, saving them the effort of
     manually encoding and decoding and this namespace extends the same convenience."
