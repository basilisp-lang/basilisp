Welcome to Basilisp's documentation!
====================================

Basilisp is a Lisp dialect inspired by Clojure targeting Python 3.

Basilisp compiles down to raw Python 3 code and executes on the Python 3
virtual machine, allowing natural interoperability between existing Python
libraries and new Lisp code.

Features
--------

* Immutable data structures
* Strong emphasis on functional programming concepts
* Seamless interoperability between Python code and Basilisp code
* Sophisticated REPL for REPL-based development
