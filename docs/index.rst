====================================

.. note::

   This documentation is incomplete and work is ongoing to improve it.

Basilisp is a Lisp dialect inspired by Clojure targeting Python 3.

Basilisp compiles down to raw Python 3 code and executes on the Python 3
virtual machine, allowing natural interoperability between existing Python
libraries and new Lisp code.

Use the links below to learn more about Basilisp and to find help if you
run into trouble using Basilisp.
