Basilisp (like Clojure) is defined by interfaces.
All of the built-in data types are implement 0 or more of these Python interfaces and :lpy:ns:`basilisp.core` functions typically operate on these interfaces, rather than concrete data types (with some exceptions).

In day-to-day usage, you will not typically need to use these interfaces, but they are nevertheless helpful for understanding the abstractions Basilisp is built upon.

.. warning::

   These interfaces are not considered part of the Basilisp public API and therefore are subject to change at any time without notice.
   This documentation is intended to help users understand the abstractions that underpin Basilisp.
