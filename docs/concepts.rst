Concepts
========

.. lpy:currentns:: basilisp.core

This document outlines some of the key high-level concepts of Basilisp, most of which behave identically to their Clojure counterparts.
The sections below tend to focus on how each of these concepts can be applied while using Basilisp.
For those looking for more of a philosophical discussion of each of these concepts, you may find the corresponding `Clojure documentation <https://clojure.org/reference>`_ enlightening as it frequently emphasizes the *motivations* for the various concepts more heavily than this documentation.

.. _data_structures:

Data Structures
---------------

Basilisp provides a comprehensive set of immutable data structures and a set of scalar types inherited from the host Python environment.

.. _nil:

nil
^^^

The value ``nil`` corresponds to Python's ``None``.
Any type is potentially ``nil``, though many Basilisp functions are intended to handle ``nil`` values gracefully.
Only the value ``nil`` and the :ref:`boolean <boolean_values>` value ``false`` are considered logical false in conditions.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`nil?`

.. _boolean_values:

Boolean Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The values ``true`` and ``false`` correspond to Python's ``True`` and ``False``, respectively.
They are singleton instances of :external:py:class:`bool`
Only the values ``nil`` and ``false`` are considered logical false in conditions.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`false?`, :lpy:fn:`true?`

.. _numbers:

Numbers
^^^^^^^

Basilisp exposes all of the built-in numeric types from Python and operations with those values match Python unless otherwise noted.

Integral values correspond to Python's arbitrary precision :external:py:class:`int` type.

Floating point values are represented by :external:py:class:`float`.
For fixed-point arithmetic with user specified precision (corresponding with Clojure's ``BigDecimal`` type float suffixed with an ``M``), Basilisp uses Python's :external:py:class:`decimal.Decimal` class.

Complex numbers are backed by Python's :external:py:class:`complex`.

Ratios are represented by Python's :external:py:class:`fractions.Fraction` type.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`arithmetic_division`

   Arithmetic functions: :lpy:fn:`+`, :lpy:fn:`-`, :lpy:fn:`*`, :lpy:fn:`/`, :lpy:fn:`abs`, :lpy:fn:`mod`, :lpy:fn:`quot`, :lpy:fn:`rem`, :lpy:fn:`inc`, :lpy:fn:`dec`, :lpy:fn:`min`, :lpy:fn:`max`

   Ratio functions: :lpy:fn:`numerator`, :lpy:fn:`denominator`

.. _strings_and_byte_strings:

Strings and Byte Strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp's string type is Python's base :external:py:class:`str` type.
Python's byte string type :external:py:class:`bytes` is also supported.

.. note::

   Basilisp does not have a first class character type since there is no equivalent in Python.
   :ref:`reader_character_literals` can be read from source code, but will be converted into single-character strings.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`format`, :lpy:fn:`subs`, :lpy:ns:`basilisp.string` for an idiomatic string manipulation library

.. _keywords:

Keywords
^^^^^^^^

Keywords are symbolic identifiers which always evaluate to themselves.
Keywords consist of a name and an optional namespace, both of which are strings.
The textual representation of a keyword includes a single leading ``:``, which is not part of the name or namespace.

Keywords are also functions of one or 2 arguments, roughly equivalent to calling :lpy:fn:`get` on a map or set with an optional default value argument.
If the first argument is a :ref:`map <maps>`, then looks up the value associated with the keyword in the map.
If the first argument is a :ref:`set <sets>`, then looks up if the keyword is a member of the set and returns itself if so.
Returns the default value or ``nil`` (if no default value is specified) if either check fails.

.. code-block::

   (def m {:kw 1 :other 2})
   (:kw m)            ;; => 1
   (get m :kw)        ;; => 1
   (:some-kw m)       ;; => nil
   (:some-kw m 3)     ;; => 3
   (get m :some-kw 3) ;; => 3

.. note::

   Keyword values are interned and keywords are compared by identity, not by value.

.. warning::

   Keywords can be created programmatically via :lpy:fn:`keyword` which may not be able to be read back by the :ref:`reader`, so use caution when creating keywords programmatically.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`keyword`, :lpy:fn:`name`, :lpy:fn:`namespace`, :lpy:fn:`keyword?`

.. _symbols:

Symbols
^^^^^^^

Symbols are symbolic identifiers which are typically used to refer to something else.
Symbols consist of a name and an optional namespace, both strings.

Symbols, like :ref:`keywords`, can also be called like a function similar to :lpy:fn:`get` on a map or set with an optional default value argument.
If the first argument is a :ref:`map <maps>`, then looks up the value associated with the symbol in the map.
If the first argument is a :ref:`set <sets>`, then looks up if the symbol is a member of the set and returns itself if so.
Returns the default value or ``nil`` (if no default value is specified) if either check fails.

.. code-block::

   (def m {'sym 1 'other 2})
   ('sym m)            ;; => 1
   (get m 'sym)        ;; => 1
   ('some-sym m)       ;; => nil
   ('some-sym m 3)     ;; => 3
   (get m 'sym 3)      ;; => 3

.. note::

   Basilisp will always try to resolve unquoted symbols, so be sure to wrap symbols in as ``(quote sym)`` or ``'sym`` if you just want a symbol.

.. warning::

   Symbols can be created programmatically via :lpy:fn:`symbol` which may not be able to be read back by the :ref:`reader`, so use caution when creating symbols programmatically.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`symbol`, :lpy:fn:`name`, :lpy:fn:`namespace`, :lpy:fn:`gensym`, :lpy:form:`quote`

.. _collection_types:

Collection Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp includes the following data structures, all of which are both immutable and persistent.
APIs which "modify" collections in fact produce new collections which may or may not share some structure with the original collection.
As a result of their immutability, all of these collections are thread-safe.

Many of Basilisp's built-in collection types support creating :ref:`transient <transients>` versions of themselves for more efficient modification in a tight loop.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`count`, :lpy:fn:`conj`, :lpy:fn:`seq`, :lpy:fn:`empty`, :lpy:fn:`not-empty`, :lpy:fn:`empty?`

.. _lists:

Lists
#####

Lists are singly-linked lists.
Unlike most other Basilisp collections, Lists directly implement :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.ISeq` (see :ref:`seqs`).
You can get the count of a list in ``O(n)`` time via :lpy:fn:`count`.
Items added via :lpy:fn:`conj` are added to the front of the list.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`list`, :lpy:fn:`peek`, :lpy:fn:`pop`, :lpy:fn:`list?`

.. _queues:

Queues
######

Queues are doubly-linked lists.
You get the count of a queue in ``O(1)`` time via :lpy:fn:`count`.
Items added via :lpy:fn:`conj` are added to the end of the queue.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`queue`, :lpy:fn:`peek`, :lpy:fn:`pop`, :lpy:fn:`queue?`

.. _vectors:

Vectors
#######

Vectors are sequential collections much more similar to Python lists or arrays in other languages.
Vectors return their count in ``O(1)`` time via :lpy:fn:`count`.
:lpy:fn:`conj` adds items to the end of a vector.
Random access to vector elements by index (via :lpy:fn:`get` or :lpy:fn:`nth`) is ``O(log32(n))``.
You can reverse a vector in constant time using :lpy:fn:`rseq`.

Vectors be called like a function similar to :lpy:fn:`nth` with an index and an optional default value, returning the value at the specified index if found.
Returns the default value or ``nil`` (if no default value is specified) otherwise.

.. code-block::

   (def v [:a :b :c])
   (v 0)                ;; => :a
   (v 5)                ;; => nil
   (v 5 :g)             ;; => :g

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`vector`, :lpy:fn:`vec`, :lpy:fn:`get`, :lpy:fn:`nth`, :lpy:fn:`peek`, :lpy:fn:`pop`, :lpy:fn:`rseq`, :lpy:fn:`vector?`

.. _maps:

Maps
####

Maps are unordered, associative collections which map arbitrary keys to values.
Keys must be hashable.
Maps return their count in ``O(1)`` time via :lpy:fn:`count`.
Random access to map values is ``O(log(n))``.

:lpy:fn:`conj` accepts any of the following types, adding new keys or replacing keys as appropriate:

- Another map; values will be merged in from left to right with keys from the rightmost map taking precedence in the instance of a conflict
- A map entry
- 2 element vector; the first element will be treated as the key and the second the value

Calling :lpy:fn:`seq` on a map yields successive map entries, which are roughly equivalent to 2 element vectors.

Maps be called like a function similar to :lpy:fn:`get` with a key and an optional default value, returning the value at the specified key if found.
Returns the default value or ``nil`` (if no default value is specified) otherwise.

.. code-block::

   (def m {:a 0 :b 1})
   (m :a)               ;; => 0
   (m :g)               ;; => nil
   (m :g 5)             ;; => 5

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`hash-map`, :lpy:fn:`assoc`, :lpy:fn:`assoc-in`, :lpy:fn:`get`, :lpy:fn:`get-in`, :lpy:fn:`find`, :lpy:fn:`update`, :lpy:fn:`update-in`, :lpy:fn:`dissoc`, :lpy:fn:`merge`, :lpy:fn:`merge-with`, :lpy:fn:`map-entry`, :lpy:fn:`key`, :lpy:fn:`val`, :lpy:fn:`keys`, :lpy:fn:`vals`, :lpy:fn:`select-keys`, :lpy:fn:`update-keys`, :lpy:fn:`update-vals`, :lpy:fn:`map?`

.. _sets:

Sets
####

Sets are unordered groups of unique values.
Values must be hashable.
Sets return their count in ``O(1)`` time via :lpy:fn:`count.`

Sets be called like a function similar to :lpy:fn:`get` with a key and an optional default value, returning the value if it exists in the set.
Returns the default value or ``nil`` (if no default value is specified) otherwise.

.. code-block::

   (def s #{:a :b :c})
   (s :a)                ;; => :a
   (s :g)                ;; => nil
   (s :g :g)             ;; => :g

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`hash-set`, :lpy:fn:`set`, :lpy:fn:`disj`, :lpy:fn:`contains?`, :lpy:fn:`set?`

.. _seqs:

Seqs
----

Seqs are an interface for sequential types that generalizes iteration to that of a singly-linked list.
However, because the functionality is defined in terms of an interface, many other data types can also be manipulated as Seqs.
The :lpy:fn:`seq` function creates an optimal Seq for the specific input type -- all built-in collection types are "Seqable".

Most of Basilisp's Seq functions operate on Seqs lazily, rather than eagerly.
This is frequently a desired behavior, but can be confusing when debugging or exploring data at the REPL.
You can force a Seq to be fully realized by collecting it into a concrete :ref:`collection type <collection_types>` or by using :lpy:fn:`doall` (among other options).

Seqs bear more than a passing resemblance to a stateful iterator type, but have some distinct advantages.
In particular, Seqs are immutable once realized and thread-safe, meaning Seqs can be be easily passed around with abandon.

Lazy seqs can be created using using the :lpy:fn:`lazy-seq` macro.

.. warning::

   There are several possible gotchas when using Seqs over mutable Python :py:class:`collections.abc.Iterable` types.
   Because Seqs are immutable, Seqs created from mutable collections can diverge from their source collection if that collection is modified after realizing the Seq.
   Also, because Seqs are realized lazily, it is possible that a Seq created from a mutable collection will capture changes to that collection after the initial Seq is created.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`lazy-seq`, :lpy:fn:`seq`, :lpy:fn:`first`, :lpy:fn:`rest`, :lpy:fn:`cons`, :lpy:fn:`next`, :lpy:fn:`second`, :lpy:fn:`seq?`, :lpy:fn:`nfirst`, :lpy:fn:`fnext`, :lpy:fn:`nnext`, :lpy:fn:`empty?`, :lpy:fn:`seq?`, :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.ISeq`, :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.ISeqable`

.. _working_with_seqs:

Working with Seqs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A significant portion of Basilisp's core library operates on Seqs.
Although most of these functions accept most or all of the builtin collection types, they typically call :lpy:fn:`seq` on the input collection argument and operate on the resulting Seq instance instead.

Many of these functions may accept Seqs and return another Seq, but still others accept a Seq and return some other concrete collection type.

Basilisp includes both the Clojure-compatible :lpy:fn:`apply` for applying a sequence as arguments to a function, but also the Python specific :lpy:fn:`apply-kw` for applying a map to Python functions accepting keyword arguments.
The :lpy:fn:`apply-method` macro is another Basilisp extension which enables easier application of sequences to Python methods.

.. note::

   When used alone, Seq library functions consume and produce Seqs.
   If multiple such functions are needed and used together, an intermediate Seq will be created for each function application.

   As an alternative, many of the Seq functions in the core library support being used in a :ref:`transducer <transducers>`.
   Transducers can often be more efficient in these cases since they do not require creating an intermediate Seq for each step.

.. seealso::

   Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the built-in Seq library functions.

   :lpy:fn:`iterate`, :lpy:fn:`range`, :lpy:fn:`reduce`, :lpy:fn:`reduce-kv`, :lpy:fn:`map`, :lpy:fn:`map-indexed`, :lpy:fn:`mapcat`, :lpy:fn:`filter`, :lpy:fn:`remove`, :lpy:fn:`keep`, :lpy:fn:`keep-indexed`, :lpy:fn:`take`, :lpy:fn:`take-while`, :lpy:fn:`drop`, :lpy:fn:`drop-while`, :lpy:fn:`drop-last`, :lpy:fn:`butlast`, :lpy:fn:`split-at`, :lpy:fn:`split-with`, :lpy:fn:`group-by`, :lpy:fn:`interpose`, :lpy:fn:`interleave`, :lpy:fn:`cycle`, :lpy:fn:`repeat`, :lpy:fn:`repeatedly`, :lpy:fn:`take-nth`, :lpy:fn:`partition`, :lpy:fn:`partition-all`, :lpy:fn:`partition-by`, :lpy:fn:`distinct`, :lpy:fn:`dedupe`, :lpy:fn:`flatten`, :lpy:fn:`take-last`, :lpy:fn:`for`

.. _other_useful_functions:

Other Useful Functions
----------------------

The sections below detail various useful groups of functions provided by Basilisp.

However, not every group of functions in the core library is detailed below and, of those which are detailed, the included list of functions is not exhaustive.

.. _control_structures:

Control Structures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp features many variations on traditional programming control structures such as ``if`` and ``while`` loops thanks to the magic of :ref:`macros`.
Using these control structure variants in preference to raw :lpy:form:`if` s can often help clarify the meaning of your code while also using reducing the amount of code you have to write.

In addition to the stalwart :lpy:fn:`condp`, :lpy:fn:`and`, and :lpy:fn:`or`, Basilisp also features threading macros which help writing clear and concise code.
Threading macros can help transform deeply nested expressions into a much more readable pipeline of expressions whose source order matches the execution order at runtime.

.. seealso::

   Control structures: :lpy:fn:`if-not`, :lpy:fn:`if-let`, :lpy:fn:`if-some`, :lpy:fn:`when`, :lpy:fn:`when-let`, :lpy:fn:`when-first`, :lpy:fn:`when-some`, :lpy:fn:`when-not`, :lpy:fn:`cond`, :lpy:fn:`and`, :lpy:fn:`or`, :lpy:fn:`not`, :lpy:fn:`dotimes`, :lpy:fn:`while`, :lpy:fn:`case`, :lpy:fn:`condp`, :lpy:fn:`with`, :lpy:fn:`doto`

   Threading macros: :lpy:fn:`->`, :lpy:fn:`->>`, :lpy:fn:`some->`, :lpy:fn:`some->>`, :lpy:fn:`cond->`, :lpy:fn:`cond->>`, :lpy:fn:`as->`

.. _function_composition:

Function Composition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp core includes many functions which facilitate function composition, which are particularly helpful when dealing with higher-order functions.

In addition to the Clojure-compatible :lpy:fn:`partial` function for partial application, Basilisp includes :lpy:fn:`partial-kw` for working with Python functions which accept keyword arguments.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`complement`, :lpy:fn:`constantly`, :lpy:fn:`comp`, :lpy:fn:`juxt`, :lpy:fn:`every?`, :lpy:fn:`every-pred`, :lpy:fn:`not-every?`, :lpy:fn:`some-fn`, :lpy:fn:`not-any?`, :lpy:fn:`trampoline`

.. _regular_expressions:

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp core includes support for regular expressions which are backed by Python's :external:py:mod:`re` module.
Pattern literals can be created using the ``#"pattern"`` :ref:`reader macro <reader_macros>` syntax or via :lpy:fn:`re-pattern` if the pattern string is not a literal.
Check for matches using :lpy:fn:`re-find`, :lpy:fn:`re-matches`, or :lpy:fn:`re-seq`.

.. code-block::

   (re-matches #"$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)" "$123.60")                              ;; => nil
   (re-matches #"\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)" "$123.60")                             ;; => ["$123.60" "123.60"]
   (re-matches #"\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)" "I spent $123.60 today")               ;; => nil
   (re-find #"\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)" "I spent $123.60 today")                  ;; => ["$123.60" "123.60"]

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`re-pattern`, :lpy:fn:`re-find`, :lpy:fn:`re-matches`, :lpy:fn:`re-seq`

.. _futures:

Futures
^^^^^^^

The Basilisp standard library includes support for futures executed on threads or processes backed by Python's :external:py:mod:`concurrent.futures` module.
By default, futures are run on a thread-pool executor (bound to the dynamic Var :lpy:var:`*executor-pool*`).
Callers can submit futures using either the :lpy:fn:`future` macro or the :lpy:fn:`future-call` function.

Users wishing to quickly parallelize work across multiple threads or processes can reach for :lpy:fn:`pmap` instead.
Like the built-in :lpy:fn:`map`, ``pmap`` executes the provided function across the input collection(s) using ``future`` and, thus, using the current pool bound to ``*executor-pool*``.

.. note::

   The default executor pool used by futures is a thread-pool, which is most appropriate for IO-bound work.
   Due to the Python GIL, the utility of a thread-pool for CPU bound work is extremely limited.

   For CPU bound tasks, consider binding :lpy:var:`*executor-pool*` to a process pool worker (an instance of ``basilisp.lang.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor``).

.. seealso::

   Using futures directly: :lpy:fn:`future`, :lpy:fn:`future-call`, :lpy:fn:`future-cancel`, :lpy:fn:`future?`, :lpy:fn:`future-cancelled?`, :lpy:fn:`future-done?`

   Executing futures on a :ref:`Seq <seqs>`: :lpy:fn:`pmap`, :lpy:fn:`pcalls`, :lpy:fn:`pvalues`, :lpy:fn:`*pmap-cpu-count*`

.. _various_functions:

Various Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Functions for throwing and introspecting exceptions: :lpy:fn:`ex-info`, :lpy:fn:`ex-cause`, :lpy:fn:`ex-data`, :lpy:fn:`ex-message`, :lpy:ns:`basilisp.stacktrace`
- Functions for generating random data: :lpy:fn:`rand`, :lpy:fn:`rand-int`, :lpy:fn:`rand-nth`, :lpy:fn:`random-uuid`, :lpy:fn:`random-sample`, :lpy:fn:`shuffle`
- Functions which can be used to introspect the Python type hierarchy: :lpy:fn:`class`, :lpy:fn:`cast`, :lpy:fn:`bases`, :lpy:fn:`supers`, :lpy:fn:`subclasses`
- Functions for parsing values from strings: :lpy:fn:`parse-double`, :lpy:fn:`parse-long`, :lpy:fn:`parse-boolean`, :lpy:fn:`parse-uuid`

.. _destructuring:

Destructuring
-------------

The most common type of name binding encountered in Basilisp code is that of a single symbol to a value.
For example, below the name ``a`` is bound to the result of the expression ``(+ 1 2)``::

   (let [a (+ 1 2)]
     a)

In many cases this form of name binding is sufficient.
However, when dealing with data nested in vectors or maps of known shapes, it would be much more convenient to bind those values directly without needing to write collection accessor functions by hand.
Basilisp supports a form of name binding known as destructuring, which allows convenient name binding of values from within sequential and associative data structures.
Destructuring is supported everywhere names are bound: :lpy:form:`fn` argument vectors, :lpy:form:`let` bindings, and :lpy:form:`loop` bindings.

.. note::

   Names without a corresponding element in the data structure (typically due to absence) will bind to ``nil``.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`destructure`

.. _sequential_destructuring:

Sequential Destructuring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sequential destructuring is used to bind values from sequential types.
The binding form for sequential destructuring is a vector.
Names in the vector will be bound to their corresponding indexed element in the sequential expression value, fetched from that type as by :lpy:fn:`nth`.
As a result, any data type supported by ``nth`` natively supports sequential destructuring, including vectors, lists, strings, Python lists, and Python tuples.
It is possible to collect the remaining unbound elements as a ``seq`` by providing a trailing name separated from the individual bindings by an ``&``.
The rest element will be bound as by :lpy:fn:`nthnext`.
It is also possible to bind the full collection to a name by adding a trailing ``:as`` name after all binding forms and optional rest binding.

.. code-block::

   (let [[a b c & others :as coll] [:a :b :c :d :e :f]]
     [a b c others coll])
   ;;=> [:a :b :c (:d :e :f) [:a :b :c :d :e :f]]

Sequential destructuring may also be nested:

.. code-block::

   (let [[[a b c] & others :as coll] [[:a :b :c] :d :e :f]]
     [a b c others coll])
   ;;=> [:a :b :c (:d :e :f) [[:a :b :c] :d :e :f]]

.. _associative_destructuring:

Associative Destructuring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Associative destructuring is used to bind values from associative types.
The binding form for associative destructuring is a map.
Names in the map will be bound to their corresponding key in the associative expression value, fetched from that type as by :lpy:fn:`get`.
Asd a result, any associative types supported by ``get`` natively supports sequential destructuring, including maps, vectors, strings, sets, and Python dicts.
It is possible to bind the full collection to a name by adding an ``:as`` key.
Default values can be provided for keys by providing a map of binding names to default values using the ``:or`` key.

.. code-block::

   (defn f [{x :a y :b :as m :or {y 18}}]
     [x y m])

   (f {:a 1 :b 2})  ;;=> [1 2 {:a 1 :b 2}]
   (f {:a 1})       ;;=> [1 18 {:a 1}]
   (f {})           ;;=> [nil 18 {}]

For the common case where the names you intend to bind directly match the corresponding keyword name, you can use the ``:keys`` notation.

.. code-block::

   (defn f [{:keys [a b] :as m}]
     [a b m])

   (f {:a 1 :b 2})  ;;=> [1 2 {:a 1 :b 2}]
   (f {:a 1})       ;;=> [1 nil {:a 1}]
   (f {})           ;;=> [nil nil {}]

There exists a corresponding construct for the symbol and string key cases as well: ``:syms`` and ``:strs``, respectively.

.. code-block::

   (defn f [{:strs [a] :syms [b] :as m}]
     [a b m])

   (f {"a" 1 'b 2})  ;;=> [1 2 {"a" 1 'b 2}]

.. note::

   The keys for the ``:strs`` construct must be convertible to valid Basilisp symbols.

It is possible to bind namespaced keys directly using either namespaced individual keys or a namespaced version of ``:keys`` as ``:ns/keys``.
Values will be bound to the symbol by their *name* only (as by :lpy:fn:`name`) -- the namespace is only used for lookup in the associative data structure.

.. code-block::

   (let [{a :a b :a/b :c/keys [c d]} {:a   "a"
                                      :b   "b"
                                      :a/a "aa"
                                      :a/b "bb"
                                      :c/c "cc"
                                      :c/d "dd"}]
     [a b c d])
   ;;=> ["a" "bb" "cc" "dd"]

.. _keyword_arguments:

Keyword Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp functions can be defined with support for keyword arguments by defining the "rest" argument in an :lpy:fn:`defn` or :lpy:fn:`fn` form with associative destructuring.
Callers can pass interleaved key/value pairs as positional arguments to the function and they will be collected into a single map argument which can be destructured.
If a single trailing map argument is passed by callers (instead of or in addition to other key/value pairs), that value will be joined into the final map.

.. code-block::

   (defn f [& {:keys [a b] :as kwargs}]
     [a b kwargs])

   (f :a 1 :b 2)    ;;=> [1 2 {:a 1 :b 2}]
   (f :a 1 {:b 2})  ;;=> [1 2 {:a 1 :b 2}]
   (f {:a 1 :b 2})  ;;=> [1 2 {:a 1 :b 2}]

.. note::

   Basilisp keyword arguments are distinct from Python keyword arguments.
   Basilisp functions can be :ref:`defined with Python compatible keyword arguments <basilisp_functions_with_kwargs>` but the style described here is intended primarily for Basilisp functions called only by other Basilisp functions.

.. warning::

   The trailing map passed to functions accepting keyword arguments will silently overwrite values passed positionally.
   Callers should take care when using the trailing map calling convention.

   .. code-block::

      (defn f [& {:keys [a b] :as kwargs}]
        [a b kwargs])

      (f :a 1 {:b 2 :a 3})
      ;;=> [3 2 {:a 3 :b 2}]

.. _nested_destructuring:

Nested Destructuring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both associative and sequential destructuring binding forms may be nested within one another.

.. code-block::

   (let [[{:keys [a] [e f] :d} [b c]] [{:a 1 :d [4 5]} [:b :c]]]
     [a b c e f])
   ;;=> [1 :b :c 4 5]

.. _macros:

Macros
------

Like many Lisps, Basilisp supports extending its syntax using macros.
Macros are created using the :lpy:fn:`defmacro` macro in :lpy:ns:`basilisp.core`.
Syntax for the macro usage generally matches that of the sibling :lpy:fn:`defn` macro, should be a relatively easy transition.

Once a macro is defined, it is immediately available to the compiler.
You may define a macro and then use it in the next form!

The primary difference between a macro and a standard function is that macros are evaluated *at compile* time and they receive unevaluated expressions, whereas functions are evaluated *at runtime* and arguments will be fully evaluated before being passed to the function.
Macros should return the unevaluated replacement code that should be compiled.
Code returned by macros *must be legal code* -- symbols must be resolvable, functions must have the correct number of arguments, maps must have keys and corresponding values, etc.

Macros created with ``defmacro`` automatically have access to two additional parameters (which *should not* be listed in the macro argument list): ``&env`` and ``&form``.
``&form`` contains the original unevaluated form (including the invocation of the macro itself).
``&env`` contains a mapping of all symbols available to the compiler at the time of macro invocation -- the values are maps representing the binding AST node.

.. note::

   Being able to extend the syntax of your language using macros is a powerful feature.
   However, with great power comes great responsibility.
   Introducing new and unusual syntax to a language can make it harder to onboard new developers and can make code harder to reason about.
   Before reaching for macros, ask yourself if the problem can be solved using standard functions first.

.. warning::

   Macro writers should take care not to emit any references to :ref:`private_vars` in their macros, as these will not resolve for users outside of the namespace they are defined in, causing compile-time errors.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`syntax_quoting`, :lpy:form:`quote`, :lpy:fn:`gensym`, :lpy:fn:`macroexpand`, :lpy:fn:`macroexpand-1`, :lpy:fn:`unquote`, :lpy:fn:`unquote-splicing`

.. _metadata:

Metadata
--------

Basilisp symbols and collection types support optional metadata.
As the name implies, metadata describes the data contained in a collection or the symbol.
Users will most frequently encounter metadata used either as a hint for the compiler or as an artifact added to a symbol after compilation.
However, metadata is reified at runtime and available for use for purposes other than compiler hints.

.. note::

   Metadata is not considered when comparing two objects for equality or when generating their hash codes.

.. note::

   Despite the fact that metadata is not considered for object equality, object metadata is nevertheless immutably linked to the object.
   Changing the metadata of an object as by :lpy:fn:`with-meta` or :lpy:fn:`vary-meta` will result in a different object.

.. code-block::

   (def m ^:kw ^python/str ^{:map :yes} {:data []})

   ;; will emit compiler metadata since we're inspecting the metadata of the Var
   (meta #'m)                                         ;; => {:end-col 48 :ns basilisp.user :end-line 1 :col 0 :file "<REPL Input>" :line 1 :name m}

   ;; will emit the metadata we created when we def'ed m
   (meta m)                                           ;; => {:kw true :tag <class 'str'> :map :yes}

   ;; with-meta replaces the metadata on a copy
   (meta (with-meta m {:kw false}))                   ;; => {:kw false}

   ;; source object metadata remains unchanged
   (meta m)                                           ;; => {:kw true :tag <class 'str'> :map :yes}

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Reading metadata on literals <reader_metadata>`, :lpy:fn:`meta`, :lpy:fn:`with-meta`, :lpy:fn:`vary-meta`

.. _delays:

Delays
------

Delays are containers for deferring expensive computations until such time as the result is needed.
Create a new delay with the :lpy:fn:`delay` macro.
Results will not be computed until you attempt to :lpy:fn:`deref` or :lpy:fn:`force` evaluation.
Once a delay has been evaluated, it caches its results and returns the cached results on subsequent accesses.

.. code-block::

   (def d (delay (println "evaluating") (+ 1 2 3)))
   (force d)                                          ;; prints "evaluating"
                                                      ;; => 6
   (force d)                                          ;; does not print
                                                      ;; => 6

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`delay`, :lpy:fn:`delay?`, :lpy:fn:`force`, :lpy:fn:`realized?`, :lpy:fn:`deref`

.. _promises:

Promises
--------

Promises are containers for receiving a deferred result, typically from another thread.
The value of a promise can be written exactly once using :lpy:fn:`deliver`.
Threads may await the results of the promise using a blocking :lpy:fn:`deref` call.

.. code-block::

   (def p (promise))
   (realized? p)                      ;; => false
   @(future (deliver p (+ 1 2 3)))
   (realized? p)                      ;; => true
   @p                                 ;; => 6
   (deliver p 7)                      ;; => nil
   @p                                 ;; => 6

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`promise`, :lpy:fn:`deliver`, :lpy:fn:`realized?`, :lpy:fn:`deref`

.. _atoms:

Atoms
-----

Atoms are mutable, thread-safe reference containers which are useful for storing state that may need to be accessed (and changed) by multiple threads.
New atoms can be created with a default value using :lpy:fn:`atom`.
The state can be mutated in a thread-safe way using :lpy:fn:`swap!` and :lpy:fn:`reset!` (among others) without needing to coordinate with other threads.
Read the value of the atom using :lpy:fn:`deref`.

.. code-block::

   (def a (atom 0))
   (swap! a inc)       ;; => 1
   @a                  ;; => 1
   (swap! a #(+ 3 %))  ;; => 4
   @a                  ;; => 4
   (reset! a 0)        ;; => 0
   @a                  ;; => 0

Atoms are designed to contain one of Basilisp's immutable :ref:`data_structures`.
The ``swap!`` function in particular uses the :lpy:fn:`compare-and-set!` function to atomically swap in the results of applying the provided function to the existing value.
``swap!`` attempts to compare and set the value in a loop until it succeeds.
Since atoms may be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, it is possible that the value of an atom has changed between when the state was polled and when the function finished computing its final result.
Update functions should therefore be free of side-effects since they may be called multiple times.

.. note::

   Atoms implement :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.IRef` and :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.IReference` and therefore support validators, watchers, and mutable metadata.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`atom`, :lpy:fn:`compare-and-set!`, :lpy:fn:`reset!`, :lpy:fn:`reset-vals!`, :lpy:fn:`swap!`, :lpy:fn:`swap-vals!`, :lpy:fn:`deref`, :ref:`reference_types`

.. _reference_types:

Reference Types
---------------

Basilisp's built-in reference types :ref:`vars` and :ref:`atoms` include support for metadata, validation, and watchers.

Unlike :ref:`metadata` on data structures, reference type metadata is mutable.
The identity of a reference type is the container, rather than the contained value, so it makes sense that if the value of a container can change so can the metadata.
:ref:`Var metadata <var_metadata>` is typically set at compile-time by a combination of compiler provided metadata and user metadata (typically via :lpy:form:`def`).
On the other hand, :ref:`atom <atoms>` have no metadata by default.
Metadata can be mutated using :lpy:fn:`alter-meta!` and :lpy:fn:`reset-meta!`.

Both Vars and atoms support validation of their contained value at the time it is set using a validator function.
Validator functions are functions of one argument returning either a single boolean value (where ``false`` indicates the value is invalid) or throwing an exception upon failure.
The validator will be called with the new proposed value of a ref before that value is applied.

.. code-block::

   (def a (atom 0))
   (set-validator! a (fn [v] (= 0 (mod v 2))))
   (swap! a inc)                                ;; => throws basilisp.lang.exception.ExceptionInfo: Invalid reference state {:data 1 :validator <...>}
   (swap! a #(+ 2 %))                           ;; => 2

Vars and atoms also feature support for watch functions which will be called on changes to the contained value.
Watch functions are functions of 4 arguments (watch key, reference value, old value, and new value).
Unlike validators, watches may not veto proposed changes to the contained value and any return value will be ignored.
A watch can be added to a reference using :lpy:fn:`add-watch` using a key and watches may be removed using :lpy:fn:`remove-watch` using the same key.

.. code-block::

   (def a (atom 0))
   (add-watch a :print (fn [_ r old new] (println r "changed from" old "to" new)))
   (swap! a inc)                 ;; => prints "<basilisp.lang.atom.Atom object at 0x113b01070> changed from 0 to 1"
                                 ;; => 1

.. note::

   Watch functions are called synchronously after a value change in an nondeterministic order.

.. warning::

   By the time a watch function is called, it is possible that the contained value has changed again, so users should use the provided arguments for the new and old value rather than attempting to :lpy:fn:`deref` the ref.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`atoms`, :ref:`vars`, :lpy:fn:`alter-meta!`, :lpy:fn:`reset-meta!`, :lpy:fn:`add-watch`, :lpy:fn:`remove-watch`, :lpy:fn:`get-validator`, :lpy:fn:`set-validator!`

.. _transients:

Transients
----------

Basilisp supports creating transient versions of most of its :ref:`persistent collections <data_structures>` using the :lpy:fn:`transient` function.
Transient versions of persistent data structures use local mutability to improve throughput for common data manipulation operations.
Because transients are mutable, they are intended to be used in local, single-threaded contexts where you may be constructing or modifying a collection.

Despite their mutability, the APIs for mutating transient collections are intentionally quite similar to that of standard persistent data structures.
Unlike classical data structure mutation APIs, you may not simply hang on to a single reference and issue repeated function calls or methods to that same data structure.
Instead, you use the transient-compatible variants of the existing persistent data structure functions (those ending with a ``!``) such as :lpy:fn:`assoc!`, :lpy:fn:`conj!`, etc.
As with the persistent data structures, you must use the return value from each of these functions as the input to subsequent operations.

Once you have completed modifying a transient, you should call :lpy:fn:`persistent!` to freeze the data structure back into its persistent variant.
After freezing a transient back into a persistent data structure, references to the transient are no longer guaranteed to be valid and may throw exceptions.

Many :lpy:ns:`basilisp.core` functions already use transients under the hood by default.
Take for example this definition of a function to merge an arbitrary number of maps (much like :lpy:fn:`merge`).

.. code-block::

   (defn merge [& maps]
     (when (some identity maps)
      (persistent!
       (reduce #(conj! %1 %2) (transient {}) maps))))

.. note::

   You can create transient versions of maps, sets, and vectors.
   Lists may not be made transient, since there would be no benefit.

.. warning::

   Transient data structures are not thread-safe and must therefore not be modified by multiple threads at once.
   It is the user's responsibility to ensure synchronization mutations to transients across threads.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`transient`, :lpy:fn:`persistent!`, :lpy:fn:`assoc!`, :lpy:fn:`conj!`, :lpy:fn:`disj!`, :lpy:fn:`dissoc!`, :lpy:fn:`pop!`

.. _volatiles:

Volatiles
---------

Volatiles are mutable, *non-thread-safe* reference containers which are useful for storing state that is mutable and is only changed in a single thread.
Create a new volatile using :lpy:fn:`volatile!`.
The stored value can be modified using :lpy:fn:`vswap!` and :lpy:fn:`vreset!`.

.. note::

   Volatiles are most frequently used for creating performant stateful :ref:`transducers`.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`volatile!`, :lpy:fn:`volatile?`, :lpy:fn:`vreset!`, :lpy:fn:`vswap!`

.. _multimethods:

Multimethods
------------

Multimethods are a form of runtime polymorphism that may feel familiar to users of type-based multiple dispatch.
Multimethods are strictly more powerful than strictly type-based dispatch systems, however.
Multimethods dispatch to methods via a user-defined dispatch function which has access to the full runtime value of every argument passed to the final function.
The value returned from a dispatch function can be any hashable value.

Methods are selected by looking up the returned dispatch value in a mapping of dispatch values to methods.
Dispatch values are compared to the stored method mappings using :lpy:fn:`isa?` which naturally supports both the usage of the :ref:`hierarchy <hierarchies>` system for sophisticated hierarchical data relationships and the Python type system.
If no method is found for the dispatch value, the default dispatch value (which defaults to ``:default`` but may be selected when the multimethod is defined) will be used to look up a method.
If no method is found after consulting the default value, a :external:py:exc:`NotImplementedError` exception will be thrown.

Users can create new multimethods using the :lpy:fn:`defmulti` macro, specifying a dispatch function, an optional default dispatch value, and a hierarchy to use for :lpy:fn:`isa?` calls.
Methods can be added with the :lpy:fn:`defmethod` macro.
Methods can be introspected using :lpy:fn:`methods` and :lpy:fn:`get-method`.
Methods can be individually removed using :lpy:fn:`remove-method` or completely removed using :lpy:fn:`remove-all-methods`.

It is possible using both hierarchies and Python's type system that there might be multiple methods corresponding to a single dispatch value.
Where such an ambiguity exists, Basilisp allows users to disambiguate which method should be selected when a conflict arises between 2 method dispatch keys using :lpy:fn:`prefer-method`.
Users can get the mapping of method preferences by calling :lpy:fn:`prefers` on the multimethod.

The following example shows a basic multimethod using a keyword to dispatch methods based on a single key in a map like a discriminated union.
The :ref:`hierarchies` section shows a more advanced example using hierarchies for method dispatch.

.. code-block::

   (defmulti calc :type)

   (defmethod calc :add
     [{:keys [vals]}]
     (apply + vals))

   (defmethod calc :mult
     [{:keys [vals]}]
     (apply * vals))

   (defmethod calc :default
     [{:keys [vals]}]
     (map inc vals))

   (calc {:type :add :vals [1 2 3]})      ;; => 6
   (calc {:type :mult :vals [4 5 6]})     ;; => 120
   (calc {:type :default :vals [4 5 6]})  ;; => (5 6 7)
   (calc {:vals [4 5 6]})                 ;; => (5 6 7)

.. note::

   If your primary use case for a multimethod is dispatching on the input type of the first argument of a multimethod, consider using a :ref:`protocol <protocols>` instead.
   Protocols are almost always faster for single-argument type based dispatch and require no manual specification of the dispatch function.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`defmulti`, :lpy:fn:`defmethod`, :lpy:fn:`methods`, :lpy:fn:`get-method`, :lpy:fn:`prefer-method`, :lpy:fn:`prefers`, :lpy:fn:`remove-method`, :lpy:fn:`remove-all-methods`

.. _hierarchies:

Hierarchies
^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp supports creating ad-hoc hierarchies which define relationships as data.
Hierarchies are particularly useful for :ref:`multimethods`, but may also be used in other contexts.

Create a new hierarchy with :lpy:fn:`make-hierarchy`.
Define relationships within that hierarchy using :lpy:fn:`derive`.
Relationships are between tags and their parent where tags are valid Python types or a namespace qualified-keyword and parents are namespace-qualified keywords.
This allows users to slot concrete host types into hierarchies, which is particularly useful in the context of :ref:`multimethods`.
Note however that hierarchies do not allow Python types to be defined as parents, because that would ultimately cause the hierarchy to diverge from the true class hierarchy on the host.

Hierarchy relationships can be removed using :lpy:fn:`underive`.
It is possible to explore the relationships in the hierarchy using :lpy:fn:`parents`, :lpy:fn:`ancestors`, and :lpy:fn:`descendants`.
Users can test whether a hierarchy element is a descendant (or equal to) another using :lpy:fn:`isa?`.

The example below combines multimethods and hierarchies to show how they can be used together.

.. code-block::

   (def m {:os :os/osx})

   (def ^:redef os-hierarchy
     (-> (make-hierarchy)
         (derive :os/osx :os/unix)))

   (defmulti os-lineage
     :os                         ;; the keyword :os is our dispatch function
     :hierarchy #'os-hierarchy)  ;; note that :hierarchies passed to multimethods must be passed as references (Var or atom)

   (defmethod os-lineage :os/unix
     [_]
     "unix")

   (defmethod os-lineage :os/bsd
     [_]
     "bsd")

   (defmethod os-lineage :default
     [_]
     "operating system")

   (os-lineage m)                  ;; => "unix"
   (os-lineage {:os :os/windows})  ;; => "operating system"

   ;; add a new parent to :os/osx which creates ambiguity in the hierarchy
   (alter-var-root #'os-hierarchy derive :os/osx :os/bsd)

   (os-lineage m)  ;; => basilisp.lang.runtime.RuntimeException

   ;; set method preference to disambiguate
   (prefer-method os-lineage :os/unix :os/bsd)

   (os-lineage m)                  ;; => "unix"
   (os-lineage {:os :os/windows})  ;; => "operating system"

.. note::

   If no hierarchy argument is provided to hierarchy functions, a default global hierarchy is used.
   To avoid conflating hierarchies, you should create your own hierarchy which you pass to the various hierarchy library functions.

.. warning::

   Hierarchies returned by :lpy:fn:`make-hierarchy` are immutable.
   To modify a hierarchy as by :lpy:fn:`derive` or :lpy:fn:`underive`, treat it like Basilisp's other immutable data structures:

   .. code-block::

      (let [h (-> (make-hierarchy)
                  (derive ::banana ::fruit)
                  (derive ::apple ::fruit))]
        ;; ...
        )

   For hierarchies that need to be modified at runtime, consider storing the hierarchy in a Ref such as an :ref:`atom <atoms>` and using ``(swap! a derive ...)`` to update the hierarchy.

.. warning::

   :lpy:fn:`isa?` is not the same as :lpy:fn:`instance?`.
   The former operates on both hierarchy members and valid Python types, but cannot check if an object is an instance of a certain type.
   In this way it is much more like the Python :external:py:func:`issubclass`.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`make-hierarchy`, :lpy:fn:`ancestors`, :lpy:fn:`descendents`, :lpy:fn:`parents`, :lpy:fn:`isa?`, :lpy:fn:`derive`, :lpy:fn:`underive`

.. _protocols:

Protocols
---------

Most of Basilisp's core functionality is written in terms of interfaces and abstractions, rather than concrete types.
The base interface types are (necessarily) all written in Python, however.
Basilisp cannot generate such interface types however, which limits its ability to create similar abstractions.

Protocols are the Basilisp-native solution to defining interfaces.
Protocols are defined as a set of functions and their associated signatures without any defined implementation (and optional docstrings).
Once created a protocol defines both an interface (a :external:py:class:`abc.ABC`) and a series of stub functions that dispatch to actual implementations based on the type of the first argument.

Users can define implementations protocol methods for any type using :lpy:fn:`extend` or the convenience macros :lpy:fn:`extend-protocol` and :lpy:fn:`extend-type`.
Type dispatch respects the Python type hierarchy, so implementations may be defined against other interface types or parent types and the most specific implementation will always be selected for the provided object.
You can fetch the collection of types which explicitly implement a Protocol using :lpy:fn:`extenders` (this will not include types which inherit from the Protocol interface, however).
However, it is possible to check if a type extends a protocol (including those types which inherit from the interface) using :lpy:fn:`extends?`.
It is possible to check if a type satisfies (e.g. implements) a Protocol using :lpy:fn:`satisfies?`.

Because Protocols ultimately generate an interface type, they may be used as an interface type of :ref:`data_types_and_records`.
Likewise, this enables Python code to participate in Protocols by referencing the generated interface.

Protocols provide a natural solution to many different problems.
As an example, :lpy:ns:`basilisp.json` uses Protocol-based dispatch for converting values into their final JSON representation.
Protocols allow other code to participate in that serialization without needing to modify the source.
Suppose you wanted to serialize :external:py:class:`datetime.datetime` instances out as Unix Epochs rather than as ISO-8601 formatted strings, you could provide a custom protocol implementation to do just that.

.. code-block::

   ;; Abbreviated protocol definition copied from basilisp.json
   (defprotocol JSONEncodeable
     (to-json-encodeable* [this opts]))

   (basilisp.json/write-str {:some-val (datetime.datetime/now)})  ;; => "{\"some-val\": \"2024-08-02T16:42:10.803582\"}"

   (extend-protocol basilisp.json/JSONEncodeable
     datetime/datetime
     (to-json-encodeable* [this _]
       (.timestamp this)))

   (basilisp.json/write-str {:some-val (datetime.datetime/now)})  ;; => "{\"some-val\": 1722631254.803805}"

.. note::

   Users *must* provide a ``self`` or ``this`` argument to arguments in :lpy:fn:`defprotocol` invocations.

.. seealso::

   :lpy:fn:`defprotocol`, :lpy:fn:`protocol?`, :lpy:fn:`extend`, :lpy:fn:`extend-protocol`, :lpy:fn:`extend-type`, :lpy:fn:`extenders`, :lpy:fn:`extends?`, :lpy:fn:`satisfies?`

.. _data_types_and_records:

Data Types and Records
----------------------

Basilisp allows 3 different methods for defining custom data types which implement Python interfaces and :ref:`protocols`, detailed in the sections below.

Each of the methods Basilisp supports for creating custom data types may implement 0 or more Python interfaces and Basilisp protocols.
Types are required to implement every function defined by any declared interfaces and protocols.

Types may also optionally implement 0 or more Python `"dunder" methods <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html>`_ without implementing every such method.

.. note::

   It is not necessary to declare :external:py:class:`object` as a superclass, but doing so is not an error.

.. warning::

   Python, unlike Java, does not have a true "interface" type.
   The best approximation is :external:py:class:`abc.ABC`, although this type is merely advisory and many libraries and applications eschew its use.

   For the cases where a host type is not defined as an ``abc.ABC`` instance, users can override the compiler check by setting the ``^:abstract`` meta key on the interface type symbol passed to the ``deftype`` form.
   For example, take :external:py:class:`argparse.Action` which is required to be implemented for customizing :external:py:mod:`argparse` actions, but which is not defined as an ``abc.ABC``:

   .. code-block::

      (import argparse)

      (reify
        ^:abstract argparse/Action
        (__call__ [this parser namespace values option-string]
          ;; ...
          ))

.. warning::

   The Basilisp compiler is not currently able to verify that the signature of implemented methods matches the interface or superclass method signature.
   Support for this feature is tracked in GitHub issue `#949 <https://github.com/basilisp-lang/basilisp/issues/949>`_.

.. _deftype:

``deftype``
^^^^^^^^^^^

In many cases it is desirable or necessary to define a Python class (or object instance which is a subtype of some type) to interact with a Python library.
To facilitate this, Basilisp includes the :lpy:fn:`deftype` macro for creating Python classes which optionally implement Python interfaces or Basilisp protocols.

Types defined via ``deftype`` may include 0 or more fields which are required at object instantiation.
Fields defined in ``deftype`` forms are immutable by default.
Attempting to set a field using :lpy:form:`set!` will result in a compile-time error.
However, it is possible to mark a field as mutable by using the ``^:mutable`` metadata on a ``deftype`` field at compile time.
Mutable fields may be ``set!`` from within class methods.
Fields may be referred to freely by name from within method definitions as in Java (and unlike in Python where they must be qualified with ``self``).

.. note::

   Fields may also specify defaults by providing the default value as a ``^:default`` metadata value.
   Adding default values to ``deftype`` fields is a Basilisp extension which is not supported by Clojure.

.. warning::

   Python is known for taking a rather lax stance on object mutability as compared to many other languages and runtimes.
   As a consequence of the language and VM not enforcing true immutability, even immutable fields may still be modified by other means.
   Users should not take the immutable default state of ``deftype`` fields as a guarantee, but rather as a principled approach to reducing the surface area of potential bugs due to mutability.

Types created by ``deftype`` automatically have some basic sensible defaults added via `attrs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/>`_, such as a constructor (whose argument order matches that of the defined fields) and Python ``__str__`` and ``__repr__`` methods.
User supplied versions of methods besides ``__init__`` may override the generated variants in all cases.

Methods may be defined with multiple arities if required by any declared protocols.
``deftype`` methods may be :ref:`defined with support for Python kwargs <basilisp_functions_with_kwargs>` exactly like plain functions.
Methods may be declared as by :external:py:func:`classmethod` and :external:py:func:`staticmethod` using the ``^:classmethod`` and ``^:staticmethod`` metadata respectively on the method name.
Static and classmethods may be defined with multiple arities.
Methods may also be declared as properties as by :external:py:class:`property` using the ``^:property`` metadata on the method name.
Property methods must be single arity.

Given a new type ``deftype`` named ``Point``, a new constructor function ``->Point`` will be created alongside the record type which accepts the full set of declared fields in the order they are declared.

.. note::

   Method definitions must include a ``self`` or ``this`` parameter.

.. note::

   Methods support tail recursion via :lpy:form:`recur`.
   When recurring, users should *not* pass the ``this`` or ``self`` parameter.

.. _reify:

``reify``
^^^^^^^^^

Whereas :ref:`deftype` defines a true Python class which may be instantiated directly, :lpy:fn:`reify` defines an anonymous type implementing the named interfaces and protocols and returns an instance of that type immediately.
Types defined via ``reify`` may not include fields.
Instead, reified types close over their environment, which can provide many of the same benefits as fields.

Reify is likely to be most useful for creating one-off types implementing some Python type, rather than for creating types that are going to be created and used frequently by consumers of your code.

Reified types always implement :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.IWithMeta` and any metadata applied to the ``reify`` form are transferred to the created object.

.. note::

   While ``reify`` and ``deftype`` are broadly similar, ``reify`` types may not define class or static methods.

.. _defrecord:

``defrecord``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basilisp offers a record type, created via :lpy:fn:`defrecord`, which is broadly similar to the types created by :ref:`deftype`.
Record types are designed to be object types which can interact more readily with the core Basilisp library as a result of implementing the map interface directly.
Records may be created from maps and fields in may be accessed, updated, and removed using standard :ref:`map <maps>` library functions.

There are some key differences from ``deftype`` types, however.

- Record types automatically implement :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.IPersistentMap`, :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.IWithMeta`, :py:class:`basilisp.lang.interfaces.IRecord`, and support for equality and hashing implemented via Python ``object`` methods.
- ``defrecord`` fields may not be marked ``^:mutable``, nor may they provide a default via ``^:default``.
- Types created by ``defrecord`` may not include :external:py:func:`classmethod`, :external:py:class:`property`, or :external:py:func:`staticmethod` methods.
- Given a defrecord type ``Point``, a constructor function ``map->Point`` will be created alongside the record type which can construct a new ``Point`` record from a map in addition to the positional constructor ``->Point``.
- Record literals may be constructed using their fully-qualified name as a :ref:`data reader <data_readers>` using a vector literal for a positional constructor or a map for a map based constructor.

.. code-block::

   (defrecord Point [x y z])
   (->Point 1 2 3)                         ;; => #basilisp.user.Point{:z 3 :x 1 :y 2}
   (def p (map->Point {:x 1 :y 2 :z 3}))   ;; => #basilisp.user.Point{:z 3 :x 1 :y 2}
   (:x p)                                  ;; => 1
   (dissoc p :x)                           ;; => {:z 3 :y 2}

   (def p1 (assoc p :name "Best point"))   ;; => #basilisp.user.Point{:z 3 :x 1 :name "Best point" :y 2}
   (dissoc p1 :name)                       ;; => #basilisp.user.Point{:z 3 :x 1 :y 2}

   #basilisp.user.Point[4 5 6]             ;; => #basilisp.user.Point{:z 6 :x 4 :y 5}
   #basilisp.user.Point{:x 4 :y 5 :z 6}    ;; => #basilisp.user.Point{:z 6 :x 4 :y 5}

.. note::

   Users may add arbitrary extra fields onto a record (as by :lpy:fn:`assoc`) without changing its type.
   If a field required by the record definition is removed as by :lpy:fn:`dissoc`, the record type will be downgraded to a standard map.
   Extra fields which are not part of the record may be removed without changing the type.
