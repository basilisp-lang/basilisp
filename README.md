# üêç basilisp üêç

A Lisp dialect inspired by Clojure targeting Python 3.

**Disclaimer:** _Basilisp is a project I created to learn about Python, Clojure,
and hosted languages generally. It should not be used in a production setting._

## Getting Started

Basilisp is developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisrink10/basilisp)
and hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/basilisp). You can
fetch Basilisp using a simple:

```bash
pip install basilisp
```

Once Basilisp is installed, you can enter into the REPL using:

```bash
basilisp repl
```

Basilisp [documentation](https://basilisp.readthedocs.io) can help guide your 
exploration at the REPL. Additionally, Basilisp features many of the same functions 
and idioms as [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) so you may find guides and 
documentation there helpful for getting started.

## Developing on Basilisp

### Requirements

This project uses [`poetry`](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/) to manage
the Python virtual environment and project dependencies. Instructions for
installing `poetry` are found in that project's `README`.

Additionally, [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended to 
manage versions of Python readily on your local development environment.
Setup of `pyenv` is somewhat more specific to your environment, so see
the documentation in the repository for more information.

### Getting Started

To prepare your `poetry` environment, you need to install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

If you have more than one version of Python installed and available (using
`pyenv`), you can switch between environments using `poetry env use [version]`
and then `poetry install`. In this way, you can test with multiple versions
of Python seamlessly. Note that `tox` will still run tests on all supported
versions automatically.

Afterwards, you can start up the REPL for development with a simple:

```bash
make repl
```

### Linting, Running Tests, and Type Checking

Basilisp automates linting, running tests, and type checking using 
[Tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox). All three steps can be performed
using a simple `make` target:

```bash
make test
```

Testing is performed using [PyTest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/). 
Type checking is performed by [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/). Linting is 
performed using [Prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/).

### PyCharm

PyCharm does not currently support `poetry` for managing Python dependencies,
so you will need to manually configure PyCharm to use the `poetry` virtual
environment. The command below will print the location of the `poetry` env,
which you can use to manually create an interpreter in PyCharm.

```bash
poetry env info -p
```
