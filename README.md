## Requirements

This project uses [`pipenv`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv) to
manage the Python virtual environment and project dependencies. `pipenv`
can be installed using Homebrew (on OS X) or `pip` otherwise:

```bash
brew install pipenv
```

```bash
pip install --user pipenv
```

Additionally, [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended to 
manage versions of Python readily on your local development environment.
Setup of `pyenv` is somewhat more specific to your environment, so see
the documentation in the repository for more information.

## Testing

Tests can be run using the following command:

```bash
make test
```
