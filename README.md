## Getting Started

Basilisp is developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/basilisp-lang/basilisp) and
hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/basilisp). You can fetch Basilisp
using a simple:

```bash
pip install basilisp
```

Once Basilisp is installed, you can enter into the REPL using:

```bash
basilisp repl
```

Basilisp [documentation](https://basilisp.readthedocs.io) (work-in-progress) can help
guide your exploration at the REPL. Additionally, Basilisp features many of the same
functions and idioms as [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) so you may find guides and
documentation there helpful for getting started.

### Who is this for?

_Me._

Basilisp is a project I created to learn about Python, Clojure, and hosted languages
generally. That said, it is generally stable at this point with reasonably high test
coverage, linting, and type checking. Work is ongoing to complete the rest  of
standard the library implementations. I suspect it could be used to build small
applications and tools at this point, though I would not recommend it unless you like
being a very early adopter.

_It should not be used in a production setting._

### On Clojure Compatibility

Basilisp strives to be roughly compatible with Clojure, but just as ClojureScript
[diverges from Clojure](https://clojurescript.org/about/differences) at points,
so too does Basilisp. Being a hosted language like Clojure (which celebrates its
host, rather than hiding it) means that certain host-specific constructs cannot
be replicated on every platform. I have tried to replicate the behavior of Clojure
as closely  as I could while still staying true to Python. If you find such a
divergence that is not due to specific host semantics, feel free to file an issue.

## Developing on Basilisp

### Requirements

This project uses [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage
the Python virtual environment, project dependencies, and package publication.
See the instructions on that repository to install in your local environment.
Because `basilisp` is intended to be used as a library, no `poetry.lock` file
is committed to the repository. Developers should generate their own lock file
and update it regularly during development instead.

Additionally, [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended to manage
versions of Python readily on your local development environment. Setup of `pyenv`
is somewhat more specific to your environment, so see the documentation in the
repository for more information.

### Getting Started

To prepare your `poetry` environment, you need to install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Afterwards, you can start up the REPL for development with a simple:

```bash
make repl
```

### Linting, Running Tests, and Type Checking

Basilisp automates linting, running tests, and type checking using 
[Tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox). All three steps can be performed
using a simple `make` target:

```bash
make test
```

Testing is performed using [PyTest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/). 
Type checking is performed by [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/). Linting is 
performed using [Prospector](https://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/).
